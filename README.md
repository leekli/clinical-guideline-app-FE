# Clinical Guideline Authoring App üè•

## Front End Application

### Overview

This application forms part of my final Disseration Project for the MSc Computer Science I am studying.

The project brief:

<div>
<i>
<strong><u>Developing an authoring platform to create and edit existing clinical guidelines.</u></strong>
<br />
<br />
As part of an ongoing research study at the School of Computing and Mathematics, we have developed a mobile device application to deliver clinical information to NHS clinicians. This MSc project aims to build a prototype clinical guideline authoring and editing platform based on existing web frameworks. The goals are to: produce a web- based application where users can utilise CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with exiting guideline documents; Implement multi-level user admin system; Utilise HTML, CSS, JS and other web-based languages; Test the system to ensure it meets usability guidelines; and conduct literature review/research/testing to ensure the system is efficient.

<br />
This is the Front End Application built with React.js, which connects to an API to make all RESTful CRUD Requests. The Back End Project can be found in the following repo: <a href="https://github.com/leekli/clinical-guideline-app-BE">Clinical Guideline Authoring App: Back End.</a>.
